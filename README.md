- Project Focus: This project revolves around predicting facial landmarks on a given face.
- Versatile Applications: Facial landmarks offer a wide range of applications, such as:
  - Detecting eye blinks.
  - Predicting subject emotions.
- Immense Potential: The possibilities and outcomes achievable through facial landmarks are intriguing and expansive.
- Feature Development: Appropriate features can be developed for various actions, including:
  - Utilizing eye-aspect-ratio (explained below) to detect blinks or winks.
  - Using mouth-aspect-ratio to identify yawns or expressions like a pout.
- Cursor Control: Project implements these actions as triggers to control the mouse cursor.
- Eye-Aspect-Ratio: This ratio aids in blink and wink detection, enhancing interaction possibilities.
- Mouth-Aspect-Ratio: This ratio can identify yawns, pouts, and other mouth-related expressions.
- Innovative Approach: This project explores using facial landmarks to create interactive controls.
- Contributions Welcome: Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or develop new features.
- Getting Started: Instructions on setup, usage, and implementation can be found in the documentation.
- Enhancing Accessibility: The project offers a unique way of interacting with technology through facial expressions.
